# BlackjackWar
### An original card game that I designed and am building that combines the nostalgia of War with the strategy of Blackjack. It has been built in Python for prototyping. It will be implemented in Unity and put on my game forum website, gamevarz.com.

#### The rules can be seen on the website here:

#### Additional Notes:
- There is an option to play 2 or 4 players because the deck needs to be split evenly.
- There is a simple computer AI (mainly for testing purposes), which will be upgraded in the future. You can choose anywhere between zero or all computer players.
- AI currently follows rule: stay on 17 unless behind in points for that hand.
