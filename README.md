# BlackjackWar
### An original card game that I designed and built that combines the nostalgia of War with the strategy of Blackjack.

#### The rules can be seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameVarz/comments/fo0d54/card_game_blackjack_war_2_or_4_players_war_with/).

#### Additional Notes:
- There is an option to play 2 or 4 players because the deck needs to be split evenly.

#### The game can be played [here](https://repl.it/@AaronLiftig/BlackjackWar).
